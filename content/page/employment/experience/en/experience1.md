### **Property Accounting Manager – Res Familiae Arnold GbR, Germany - Part Time** 
#### Aug 2023 – Present  

I originally started working for this business in **2018** and stayed for about a year, but due to time constraints, I had to step away. However, when my family and I moved to **Germany in 2023**, they gave me the opportunity to **rejoin the company**, allowing me to pick up where I left off and apply my enhanced expertise.  

In this role, I have been responsible for structuring and improving the financial processes of a real estate business in Germany. I implemented a **new accounting system** that streamlined operations, improved data accuracy, and ensured compliance with **German accounting standards (HGB)**. Working closely with tax advisors and legal entities, I manage the **financial reporting, property transactions, and reconciliations**, ensuring that everything runs smoothly.  

This position has strengthened my ability to **navigate the complexities of real estate accounting** in Germany while improving **efficiency through digital solutions**. It has been a great opportunity to apply my financial expertise in a highly regulated sector and to deepen my knowledge of the **local financial and legal environment**.
