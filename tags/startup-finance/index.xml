&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://kaufhaus-der-anden.com">Kaufhaus der Anden&lt;/a> is my own entrepreneurial venture, a &lt;strong>multi-brand platform&lt;/strong> that brings together &lt;strong>handmade, cultural, and eco-friendly&lt;/strong> products from the &lt;strong>Andean region&lt;/strong>. As the &lt;strong>founder and owner&lt;/strong>, I oversee every aspect of the business, from &lt;strong>product sourcing and supplier partnerships&lt;/strong> to &lt;strong>financial management, marketing, and customer experience&lt;/strong>. This business is more than just an eCommerce store; it is a &lt;strong>platform that highlights artisans and small entrepreneurs&lt;/strong>, ensuring their craftsmanship reaches a wider market.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Accounting, Finance, and Management</title><link>https://lina2358.github.io/myCV/page/employment/experience/en/experience2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 11:40:54 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://lina2358.github.io/myCV/page/employment/experience/en/experience2/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="finance-and-accounting-manager--pristina-company-sas-remote">&lt;strong>Finance and Accounting Manager – Pristina Company SAS, Remote&lt;/strong>&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Joining this company was an opportunity to &lt;strong>reshape financial operations&lt;/strong> from the ground up. My biggest accomplishment has been leading the &lt;strong>implementation of the company’s first ERP system&lt;/strong>, transitioning financial management from &lt;strong>Excel-based processes to a fully integrated digital platform&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I oversee &lt;strong>financial reporting, cash flow management, and tax compliance&lt;/strong>, ensuring that the company maintains transparency and efficiency. Additionally, I have developed a structured &lt;strong>document archiving system&lt;/strong> to improve regulatory compliance and financial analysis. The role has allowed me to refine my &lt;strong>analytical and process-optimization skills&lt;/strong>, proving that smart financial management can &lt;strong>drive better decision-making and business stability&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Food Service Entrepreneurship</title><link>https://lina2358.github.io/myCV/page/employment/experience/en/experience3/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 11:40:54 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://lina2358.github.io/myCV/page/employment/experience/en/experience3/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="typical-restaurants--founder--business-owner-bogotá-colombia">&lt;strong>Typical Restaurants – Founder &amp;amp; Business Owner, Bogotá, Colombia&lt;/strong>&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Starting my own restaurant was one of the most &lt;strong>challenging and rewarding experiences&lt;/strong> of my career. It was not just about running a business—it was about &lt;strong>transforming an idea into a thriving operation&lt;/strong>. I took charge of everything from &lt;strong>financial planning and marketing strategies to operations and customer service&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Through a &lt;strong>data-driven approach&lt;/strong>, I optimized &lt;strong>inventory management, pricing strategies, and supplier negotiations&lt;/strong>, which led to a &lt;strong>150% increase in sales&lt;/strong>. A strong focus on &lt;strong>brand identity and social media marketing&lt;/strong> helped us grow to over &lt;strong>4,000 followers in just three months&lt;/strong>.

&lt;p>Building something from scratch has always been my passion, and this role was exactly that—a chance to &lt;strong>establish and lead an entire eCommerce operation&lt;/strong> from the ground up. Within just three months, I helped &lt;strong>set up a local subsidiary of a Russian company&lt;/strong>, overseeing key areas such as &lt;strong>finance, accounting, HR, fulfillment, logistics, and customer service&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Managing sales of up to &lt;strong>$30,000 per day&lt;/strong>, ensuring the timely delivery of over &lt;strong>1,500 packages daily&lt;/strong>, and leading a &lt;strong>250-person team&lt;/strong> required &lt;strong>strong leadership, problem-solving, and strategic decision-making&lt;/strong>.

&lt;p>Additionally, I developed and led the &lt;strong>BPO division for accounting and payroll&lt;/strong>, an experience that enhanced my ability to &lt;strong>analyze business needs, customize ERP solutions, and improve workflow automation&lt;/strong>. This role reinforced my belief that &lt;strong>technology can revolutionize financial management&lt;/strong>, making processes more &lt;strong>transparent, accurate, and scalable&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Accounting and Management Support</title><link>https://lina2358.github.io/myCV/page/employment/experience/en/experience6/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 11:40:54 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://lina2358.github.io/myCV/page/employment/experience/en/experience6/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="executive--business-manager--el-alemán-sas-bogotá-colombia">&lt;strong>Executive &amp;amp; Business Manager – El Alemán SAS, Bogotá, Colombia&lt;/strong>&lt;/h3>

I was responsible for &lt;strong>finance, HR, inventory, procurement, manufacturing, and sales&lt;/strong>, leading a &lt;strong>cross-functional team&lt;/strong> and ensuring the company operated efficiently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of my key achievements was &lt;strong>opening the company’s first store&lt;/strong>, which involved handling everything from &lt;strong>market analysis and logistics to financial planning and supplier negotiations&lt;/strong>. Managing &lt;strong>payroll, imports, and financial reporting&lt;/strong>, I developed a &lt;strong>holistic view of business operations&lt;/strong>, strengthening my ability to &lt;strong>connect finance with strategy&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Employment</title><link>https://lina2358.github.io/myCV/page/employment/employment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 13:18:45 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://lina2358.github.io/myCV/page/employment/employment/</guid><description>&lt;p>Over the years, I have built a career that blends finance, accounting, business management, and technology, allowing me to develop a strategic and analytical mindset while staying adaptable to different industries.
