Over the years, I have built a career that blends finance, accounting, business management, and technology, allowing me to develop a strategic and analytical mindset while staying adaptable to different industries. From leading financial operations and optimizing business processes to implementing ERP systems and running my own company, my experience has been shaped by challenges, growth, and the drive to make an impact.
