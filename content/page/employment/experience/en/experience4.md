### **Head of Branch – 8Bit Group, Bogotá, Colombia** 
#### Sep 2017 – Dec 2019

Building something from scratch has always been my passion, and this role was exactly that—a chance to **establish and lead an entire eCommerce operation** from the ground up. Within just three months, I helped **set up a local subsidiary of a Russian company**, overseeing key areas such as **finance, accounting, HR, fulfillment, logistics, and customer service**.  

Managing sales of up to **$30,000 per day**, ensuring the timely delivery of over **1,500 packages daily**, and leading a **250-person team** required **strong leadership, problem-solving, and strategic decision-making**. I negotiated contracts with **last-mile delivery companies**, developed **new product lines**, and implemented **KPIs across all areas**, boosting efficiency by **50%**.  

Beyond operations, I took on the **role of legal representative**, ensuring full compliance with local regulations. This experience sharpened my ability to **handle high-pressure environments, manage large-scale operations, and drive business success**.
