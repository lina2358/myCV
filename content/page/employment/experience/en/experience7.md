### **Founder & Owner – Kaufhaus der Anden, Germany** 
#### 2023 – Present

[Kaufhaus der Anden](https://kaufhaus-der-anden.com) is my own entrepreneurial venture, a **multi-brand platform** that brings together **handmade, cultural, and eco-friendly** products from the **Andean region**. As the **founder and owner**, I oversee every aspect of the business, from **product sourcing and supplier partnerships** to **financial management, marketing, and customer experience**. This business is more than just an eCommerce store; it is a **platform that highlights artisans and small entrepreneurs**, ensuring their craftsmanship reaches a wider market.  

From day one, I have been fully responsible for **brand identity, online presence, and operational efficiency**. I built the company’s website from scratch, managed its **SEO strategy**, and developed digital marketing campaigns to **enhance visibility and engagement**. Beyond that, I handle **logistics, inventory management, and financial planning**, ensuring that the business remains **profitable and scalable**.  

Running Kaufhaus der Anden has been a deeply **fulfilling challenge**, allowing me to apply my skills in **finance, accounting, digital strategy, and business development** while also fueling my passion for supporting **sustainable and ethical commerce**. It has reinforced my ability to **adapt, lead, and innovate in a competitive online retail environment**.
