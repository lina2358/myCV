### **Typical Restaurants – Founder & Business Owner, Bogotá, Colombia**
#### Feb 2021 – Jul 2022
  
Starting my own restaurant was one of the most **challenging and rewarding experiences** of my career. It was not just about running a business—it was about **transforming an idea into a thriving operation**. I took charge of everything from **financial planning and marketing strategies to operations and customer service**.  

Through a **data-driven approach**, I optimized **inventory management, pricing strategies, and supplier negotiations**, which led to a **150% increase in sales**. A strong focus on **brand identity and social media marketing** helped us grow to over **4,000 followers in just three months**. Additionally, I successfully implemented **cost control measures and efficiency improvements** that made the business sustainable.  

The real test came with the **COVID-19 crisis**, but instead of letting it take us down, I adapted by **creating a delivery channel, partnering with local companies, and leveraging food delivery platforms**, which not only kept the business afloat but also made it more visible in the market. Eventually, I successfully **sold the business at a 120% profit**, closing this chapter with a valuable lesson in **resilience, business strategy, and adaptability**.
