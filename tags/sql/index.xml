&lt;p>Building something from scratch has always been my passion, and this role was exactly that—a chance to &lt;strong>establish and lead an entire eCommerce operation&lt;/strong> from the ground up. Within just three months, I helped &lt;strong>set up a local subsidiary of a Russian company&lt;/strong>, overseeing key areas such as &lt;strong>finance, accounting, HR, fulfillment, logistics, and customer service&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Managing sales of up to &lt;strong>$30,000 per day&lt;/strong>, ensuring the timely delivery of over &lt;strong>1,500 packages daily&lt;/strong>, and leading a &lt;strong>250-person team&lt;/strong> required &lt;strong>strong leadership, problem-solving, and strategic decision-making&lt;/strong>. I negotiated contracts with &lt;strong>last-mile delivery companies&lt;/strong>, developed &lt;strong>new product lines&lt;/strong>, and implemented &lt;strong>KPIs across all areas&lt;/strong>, boosting efficiency by &lt;strong>50%&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ERP Software Implementation</title><link>https://lina2358.github.io/myCV/page/employment/experience/en/experience5/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 11:40:54 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://lina2358.github.io/myCV/page/employment/experience/en/experience5/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="odoo-expert--xoe-corp-sas-bogotá-colombia">&lt;strong>Odoo Expert – XOE CORP.

&lt;p>My journey into &lt;strong>ERP systems and digital transformation&lt;/strong> took off in this role, where I became an &lt;strong>Odoo specialist for accounting and payroll solutions&lt;/strong>. I helped companies &lt;strong>optimize their financial processes&lt;/strong> by configuring and implementing &lt;strong>ERP solutions&lt;/strong>, training teams, and ensuring that financial management was &lt;strong>efficient and compliant&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, I developed and led the &lt;strong>BPO division for accounting and payroll&lt;/strong>, an experience that enhanced my ability to &lt;strong>analyze business needs, customize ERP solutions, and improve workflow automation&lt;/strong>. This role reinforced my belief that &lt;strong>technology can revolutionize financial management&lt;/strong>, making processes more &lt;strong>transparent, accurate, and scalable&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Employment</title><link>https://lina2358.github.io/myCV/page/employment/employment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 13:18:45 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://lina2358.github.io/myCV/page/employment/employment/</guid><description>&lt;p>Over the years, I have built a career that blends finance, accounting, business management, and technology, allowing me to develop a strategic and analytical mindset while staying adaptable to different industries.
