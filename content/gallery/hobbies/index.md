While my professional background is deeply rooted in **finance, accounting, and business strategy**, I have always believed that true fulfillment comes from engaging in **passions that inspire and energize me**. Two of my greatest personal pursuits are **Kaufhaus der Anden** and **my passion for painting**, both of which allow me to express creativity, appreciation for culture, and a connection to craftsmanship.  

#### **Kaufhaus der Anden: A Passion Project with Purpose**  
Kaufhaus der Anden is more than a business to me, it is a **labor of love**, a space where I bring together **handmade, cultural, and eco-friendly** products from the **Andean region**, from my favourite and most beautiful places. While it is a business that should be profitable, I see it primarily as a **platform for artisans and small entrepreneurs**, ensuring that their craftsmanship reaches a wider audience. Running KDA is not about financial dependence but about **curating something meaningful** that reflects my passion for culture, sustainability, and ethical commerce.  

#### **Painting: A Creative Escape**  
Beyond business and finance, painting has always been my **personal retreat**, a way to unwind, disconnect, and immerse myself in the creative process. Whether through colors, textures, or compositions, painting allows me to **express emotions, ideas, and perspectives** in ways that words cannot. It is not something I pursue for profit but purely for the **joy of creating**.  

Both Kaufhaus der Anden and painting are **integral parts of who I am**, offering a balance between my professional expertise and my personal fulfillment. They remind me that beyond numbers, strategies, and business decisions, there is always room for **passion, art, and creativity**.
