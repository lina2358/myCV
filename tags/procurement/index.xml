&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://kaufhaus-der-anden.com">Kaufhaus der Anden&lt;/a> is my own entrepreneurial venture, a &lt;strong>multi-brand platform&lt;/strong> that brings together &lt;strong>handmade, cultural, and eco-friendly&lt;/strong> products from the &lt;strong>Andean region&lt;/strong>. As the &lt;strong>founder and owner&lt;/strong>, I oversee every aspect of the business, from &lt;strong>product sourcing and supplier partnerships&lt;/strong> to &lt;strong>financial management, marketing, and customer experience&lt;/strong>. This business is more than just an eCommerce store; it is a &lt;strong>platform that highlights artisans and small entrepreneurs&lt;/strong>, ensuring their craftsmanship reaches a wider market.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CEO</title><link>https://lina2358.github.io/myCV/page/employment/experience/en/experience4/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 11:40:54 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://lina2358.github.io/myCV/page/employment/experience/en/experience4/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="head-of-branch--8bit-group-bogotá-colombia">&lt;strong>Head of Branch – 8Bit Group, Bogotá, Colombia&lt;/strong>&lt;/h3>
&lt;h4 id="sep-2017--dec-2019">Sep 2017 – Dec 2019&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Building something from scratch has always been my passion, and this role was exactly that—a chance to &lt;strong>establish and lead an entire eCommerce operation&lt;/strong> from the ground up. Within just three months, I helped &lt;strong>set up a local subsidiary of a Russian company&lt;/strong>, overseeing key areas such as &lt;strong>finance, accounting, HR, fulfillment, logistics, and customer service&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Managing sales of up to &lt;strong>$30,000 per day&lt;/strong>, ensuring the timely delivery of over &lt;strong>1,500 packages daily&lt;/strong>, and leading a &lt;strong>250-person team&lt;/strong> required &lt;strong>strong leadership, problem-solving, and strategic decision-making&lt;/strong>. I negotiated contracts with &lt;strong>last-mile delivery companies&lt;/strong>, developed &lt;strong>new product lines&lt;/strong>, and implemented &lt;strong>KPIs across all areas&lt;/strong>, boosting efficiency by &lt;strong>50%&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Accounting and Management Support</title><link>https://lina2358.github.io/myCV/page/employment/experience/en/experience6/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 11:40:54 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://lina2358.github.io/myCV/page/employment/experience/en/experience6/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="executive--business-manager--el-alemán-sas-bogotá-colombia">&lt;strong>Executive &amp;amp; Business Manager – El Alemán SAS, Bogotá, Colombia&lt;/strong>&lt;/h3>
&lt;h4 id="jan-2016--aug-2017">Jan 2016 – Aug 2017&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>This role gave me the &lt;strong>full spectrum of business management experience&lt;/strong>. I was responsible for &lt;strong>finance, HR, inventory, procurement, manufacturing, and sales&lt;/strong>, leading a &lt;strong>cross-functional team&lt;/strong> and ensuring the company operated efficiently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of my key achievements was &lt;strong>opening the company’s first store&lt;/strong>, which involved handling everything from &lt;strong>market analysis and logistics to financial planning and supplier negotiations&lt;/strong>. Managing &lt;strong>payroll, imports, and financial reporting&lt;/strong>, I developed a &lt;strong>holistic view of business operations&lt;/strong>, strengthening my ability to &lt;strong>connect finance with strategy&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Employment</title><link>https://lina2358.github.io/myCV/page/employment/employment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 13:18:45 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://lina2358.github.io/myCV/page/employment/employment/</guid><description>&lt;p>Over the years, I have built a career that blends finance, accounting, business management, and technology, allowing me to develop a strategic and analytical mindset while staying adaptable to different industries.
